    <h1>Trident Helps You Maximize Your Dive Efficiency</h1>

Use Trident to scout your dive conditions and location before you suit up. Trident can dive quickly to 100m and is maneuverable and compact enough to explore deeper and more dangerous areas. During a surface interval, why not use Trident to find a new dive site?
