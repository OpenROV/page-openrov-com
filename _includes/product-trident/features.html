                    Our goal is to make the easiest, most intuitive telerobotic control
                    system possible. We have embraced the latest emerging internet 
                    standards from HTML5 and webRTC to WebVR and WebGL to 
                    deliver a rich piloting experience through just a browser that runs 
                    on laptops, tablets, and modern mobile devices.

                    The software that drives Trident is a living open-source project. The 
                    same software that drives our previous ROV has been continually 
                    updated by both the community and our software team. Some of 
                    those changes included:
                </p>

                <p>
                    Software plugins that allow any ROV enthusiast to deliver improved 
                    ROV capabilities to the whole OpenROV community via small 
                    Internet delivered update packages.
                    UI Themes so that you can change the look and feel of the piloting 
                    experience.

                    With Trident we are focused on an amazing out-of-the-box 
                    experience. We are reviewing every bit of the user experience

                We've designed Trident to be ultra portable and ultra durable. The form factor is small enough to 
                fit in a backpack or fit under an airplane seat. The side panels are overmolded with a 
                strong, rubber coating, which gives it protection from underwater obstacles as well as 
                rough handling when being transported.

                    One of the secrets of its versatility is the unique,
                    hydrodynamically offset thruster design. This configuration 
                    allows you to move through the water fast and efficiently 
                    when you want to rapidly search an area or run a transect, 
                    but also allows you to maneuver very delicately when in 
                    tight quarters or while looking at a particular target.

                    <p>                
                    By taking advantage of drag's exponential relationship with 
                    velocity, the off-center vertical thruster of the ROV can 
                    cause it to pitch at high speeds but also hover or change 
                    depth without pitching while operating at low speeds - 
                    similar to the way a traditional ROV works.

                The data connection to Trident is a major evolution from the
                connection setup of the original OpenROV kit. It uses a neutrally 
                buoyant tether to communicate to a towable buoy on the surface 
                (radio waves don't travel well in water) and the buoy connects to 
                the pilot using a long range WiFi signal. Using a wireless 
                towable buoy greatly increases the practical range of the vehicle 
                while doing transects and search patterns since a physical 
                connection between the vehicle and the pilot doesn't need to be 
                maintained. You can connect to the buoy and control Trident 
                using a tablet or laptop from a boat or from the shore.
