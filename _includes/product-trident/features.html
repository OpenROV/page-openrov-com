                    Our goal is to make the easiest, most intuitive telerobotic control
                    system possible. We have embraced the latest emerging internet 
                    standards from HTML5 and webRTC to WebVR and WebGL to 
                    deliver a rich piloting experience through just a browser that runs 
                    on laptops, tablets, and modern mobile devices.

                    The software that drives Trident is a living open-source project. The 
                    same software that drives our previous ROV has been continually 
                    updated by both the community and our software team. Some of 
                    those changes included:
                </p>

                <p>
                    Software plugins that allow any ROV enthusiast to deliver improved 
                    ROV capabilities to the whole OpenROV community via small 
                    Internet delivered update packages.
                    UI Themes so that you can change the look and feel of the piloting 
                    experience.

                    industrial ROVs, now available to everyone.
                    With Trident we are focused on an amazing out-of-the-box 
                    experience. We are reviewing every bit of the user experience 
                    regarding our software to ensure the most simple and intuitive 
                    experience possible.

                We've designed Trident to be ultra portable and ultra durable. The form factor is small enough to 
                fit in a backpack or fit under an airplane seat. The side panels are overmolded with a 
                strong, rubber coating, which gives it protection from underwater obstacles as well as 
                rough handling when being transported.
