                                OpenROV has sold more than 3,000 of a first-generation submarine, which is able to navigate below the surface, 
                                connected by a thin cable and controlled by software running on a tablet or smartphone. The new Trident, which 
                                will go on sale this fall for $1,499, will travel at speeds of almost four knots underwater and will have a 
                                high-resolution camera and a lighting system as bright as car headlights. It will operate from a wirelessly connected buoy.

                                UNDERWATER EXPLORATION HAS traditionally been an exclusive endeavor, 
                                accessible only to deep-pocketed adventurers or researchers backed by government 
                                scientific agencies. But with the recent rise of citizen science and low-cost, open-source tools,
                                the boundaries to underwater exploration are rapidly being degraded. OpenROV has been leading the 
                                charge since 2012, offering low-cost (sub-$1000) submersibles [...].

                            <p>The OpenROV project's focus is affordability and accessibility,
                                 allowing exploration to be available for those who do not have big budgets.

                            <p>David Lang is a maker who taught himself to become an amateur oceanographer â€” or,
                                he taught a robot to be one for him. In a charming talk Lang, a TED Fellow, shows 
                                how he and a network of ocean lovers teamed up to build open-sourced, low-cost underwater explorers.
