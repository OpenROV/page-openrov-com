                        <h1>About</h1>
                          <p>OpenROV is a open-source underwater robot. But it's so much more. It's also a community of people who are working together to create more accessible, affordable, and awesome tools for underwater exploration.</p>
                            <p>The backbone of the project is the global community of DIY ocean explorers who are working, tinkering and improving the OpenROV design. The community ranges from professional ocean engineers to hobbyists, software developers to students. It's a welcoming community and everyone's feedback and input is valued.</p>
                            <p>The project started in a garage in Cupertino, with a few guys who wanted to <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/28/a-mini-sub-made-from-cheap-parts-could-change-underwater-exploration/" target="_blank">explore an underwater cave</a>. &nbsp;After finding a global community of <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/openrov/openrov-the-open-source-underwater-robot" target="_blank">co-developers on Kickstarter</a>, the project has evolved into a network of connected devices, exploring the oceans and lakes of the world.&nbsp;</p>
