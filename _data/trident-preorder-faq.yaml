    - title: "When is my Trident going to ship?"
      value: "We can’t wait either, trust us. The answer is quite complicated and as we get closer each month we get better and more accurate
                information from our many suppliers, engineers, and contract manufacturers. The most up to date information
                goes into our monthly updates which can be found on the 
                <a href='https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/openrov/openrov-trident-an-underwater-drone-for-everyone' target='_blank'> Kickstarter Trident page</a> or on our <a href='http://blog.openrov.com/' target='_blank'>blog</a>.
                Please follow along and let us know if you have any questions.

                <br>
                Prior to charging your credit card we will issue a target shipping date. OpenROV will make every effort to ensure you receive
                your Trident on or before this date. Any changes to this date will be emailed to you along with a full
                explanation of delay, a new target ship date, and any action needed."
    - title: "When are you going to charge my credit card?"
      value: "Credit cards will be charged several months ahead of delivery date.
                <br>
                <br>
                We will give you two weeks notice before charging your card. You may, at that time (or anytime before), change your credit
                card information or cancel your order. To make a change to your order click <a href='https://orders.trycelery.com/status/'
                    target='_blank'>here</a> and enter your order number and email address. You can find your order number
                in the confirmation email you should have received after placing a pre-order. Note: if you cancel your
                order you will lose your place in line for shipping priority and the locked in price from when you placed
                your order if you decide to order again later.
                <br>
                <br>
                You can request a refund at any time prior to shipping.

    - title: "Can you charge my credit card right now?"
      value: "Right now we aren’t currently capturing early payments. We have plans to change this to accommodate customers who would want
               to. If you’d like to be notified when we are ready for this, please send an email to <a href='mailto:support@openrov.com'>support@openrov.com</a>.
               Charging early won't affect your place in line, fulfillment, or price of Trident."
            
    - title: "Can I pay using a bank transfer, paypal, or other method of payment?"
      value: "Not at the moment, but hopefully we will be able to soon. If you require a different payment method, send an email to support@openrov.com
              and we will contact you when it becomes available."

    - title: "Why are you charging my credit card so far in advance?"
      value: "We are using the funding from pre-orders for expanding Trident production. More specifically, purchasing tooling, components,
              and materials. If you want to know more about the process, we are publishing it in detail on the

                    target='_blank'>Kickstarter Trident page</a> and on our <a href='http://blog.openrov.com/' target='_blank'>blog</a>.
                    Because many of the parts of Trident are highly specialized and custom manufactured our sources require
                    payment for these items up front. Larger companies are able to draw on outside funding and sales
                    for this, but Trident, as a crowdsourced project, relies on funding from community backers.

    - title: "How can I add an extra tether and/or a carry case to my pre-order?"
      value: "If we haven’t charged your credit card already, it’s easy--just email <a href='mailto:support@openrov.com'>support@openrov.com</a>. We will adjust your order and
              send you an email confirmation.
              <br>
              <br>
              If we have already charged your card don’t worry, we will offer the option to upgrade prior to shipping. These items may
              arrive separately from the original pre-order."

    - title: "How do I update my address and/or payment information for a pre-order?"
      value: "You can change your shipping address and/or payment information anytime prior to your credit card being charged by clicking
               <a href='https://orders.trycelery.com/status/' target='_blank'>here</a>."

    - title: "What if I want to cancel my order?"
      value: "You can cancel your order and receive a full refund any time prior to shipping. Simply follow the link
              <a href='https://orders.trycelery.com/status/' target='blank'>here</a> and click “cancel order.” If you would like to cancel your order and have already been charged,
              you can email us at support@openrov.com and we will issue a refund."
    - title: "I have a great idea and I think it’s good enough to get some Tridents free or discounted."
      value: "  We designed Trident for people who have a great idea and need access to tools like this but don’t have the budget for commercial
                ROVs. Because we are already priced for hobbyists and enthusiasts it’s not likely that we can give further
                discounts, but if you think we would be interested in hearing about your idea, send an email to support@openrov.com.

                    find collaborators, and inspire others."
    
    - title: "Is there volume pricing for companies and groups?"
      value: "Trident is already heavily discounted during the pre-order phase but for larger orders we can make arrangements for volume
               pricing. Please send an email to support@openrov.com and let us know what you’re thinking."

    - title: "What about becoming a reseller?"
      value: "                    Currently we don’t have an official policy regarding distribution or reselling. We are making some minor moves and testing
                    some models out to see what will work for us. If you are interested in getting involved, please send
                    an email to zack@openrov.com with information about your company including: what countries and languages
                    you plan to be selling in, what other products you currently carry or plan to carry, what level of tech
                    support you are prepared to offer, and anything else you think we would be interested in knowing."
                
    - title: "Do you ship Trident internationally? What import taxes and duties do I need to pay?"
      value: "                    Trident ships internationally to most countries. Several countries have restrictions about shipping high value items to individuals.
                    If you think you are in a country that might have problems, send an email to support@openrov.com and
                    we will look into it with you.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                                        Duties and taxes are required for importing goods to most countries. Every country has its own set of rules, taxes, and duties.
                    Before ordering you should be aware of the possible charges. There are a few online calculators that
                    will help you estimate your total landed cost but they are not guaranteed to be accurate. Some of these
                    calculators require an harmonization code (HS code) to work, and while we don’t have one for Trident
                    yet you might try <a href='http://www.dutycalculator.com/hs-lookup/937258/hs-tariff-code-for-drone/'
                        target='_blank'>this one</a> to get an idea."

  items: 
    - title: "How can I add an extra tether and/or a carry case to my Kickstarter pledge?"
      value: "If you are a Kickstarter Trident backer you will be able to add on the extras and upgrades at a kickstarter exclusive price
                    and you will have a chance to do this prior to shipping."
    
    - title: "I missed out on the early Trident pricing, can I still get Trident at the early bird prices?"
      value: "We wanted to give the biggest discounts to our earliest supporters. Although the Kickstarter early bird prices are no longer
                    available, the pre-order price for Trident is still heavily discounted for a limited time."

    - title: "How do I update my shipping address as a Kickstarter backer?"
      value: "Email us at <a href='mailto:support@openrov.com'>support@openrov.com</a> and we can change it for you or wait to receive a shipping survey closer to Trident’s ship date."
