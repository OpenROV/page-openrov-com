  quote:    OpenROV has sold more than 3,000 of a first-generation submarine, which is able to navigate below the surface, 
            connected by a thin cable and controlled by software running on a tablet or smartphone. The new Trident, which 
            will go on sale this fall for $1,499, will travel at speeds of almost four knots underwater and will have a 
            high-resolution camera and a lighting system as bright as car headlights. It will operate from a wirelessly connected buoy.

  quote:    UNDERWATER EXPLORATION HAS traditionally been an exclusive endeavor, 
            accessible only to deep-pocketed adventurers or researchers backed by government 
            scientific agencies. But with the recent rise of citizen science and low-cost, open-source tools,
            the boundaries to underwater exploration are rapidly being degraded. OpenROV has been leading the 
            charge since 2012, offering low-cost (sub-$1000) submersibles [...].

  quote:    A low-cost underwater drone has provided one of the closest 
            looks at the SS Tahoe shipwreck for more than 70 years.

            The OpenROV project's focus is affordability and accessibility,
            allowing exploration to be available for those who do not have big budgets.

  title:    How to investigate the bottom of the ocean — without getting wet
  quote:    Imagine climbing into the cockpit of your own personal submarine, zooming and diving through 
            the depths of the ocean and exploring otherwise-unreachable underwater worlds — all without needing to 
            know how to swim. That’s the promise of Trident, a new, ultra-compact underwater drone that can travel 
            faster, dive deeper and stay submerged longer than the average scuba diver can, all while sharing 
            discoveries live to the Internet. David Lang, TED Fellow and co-founder of OpenROV – 
            the robotics company that pioneered the world’s first open source, low-cost underwater robot – 
            shares why he thinks this new robot heralds a new era of underwater exploration.

  quote:    OpenROV shared the results of their June 2016 underwater expedition to locate and robotically explore the wreck of the S.S. Tahoe, currently sitting at a depth of 150m in Lake Tahoe. Back in 1940 the ship was intentionally scuttled in shallow water, but unexpectedly slid to a much      
            deeper depth. OpenROV used a modified version of their new Trident design to dive all the way down to the wreck and take a good look at things, streaming it over the internet in the process.
